 * Materials - a proof of concept.
 *
 * Every material here shares one engine. The SDF scene, the springs, the
 * fusing, the joins and the height field are the same code the plasma theme
 * has always run; only the composite pass differs. That is the whole claim
 * this page exists to test: that the library is a field renderer which happens
 * to ship glass, rather than a glass renderer.
 *
 * One material is shown at a time, because they are a uniform branch rather
 * than separate passes - two at once would mean two composites.

    blurb: "Glass with its bevel cut into facets.",
    technique:
      "The normal is snapped to seven directions, so the lens jumps between flats. Refracted twice — in the front face and out the back — and dispersed on both legs. The bright edge is total internal reflection, not a drawn outline.",
  },
  metal: {
    blurb: "A conductor: no diffuse, all reflection.",
    technique:
      "GGX specular with a Smith geometry term and Schlick fresnel. The environment is sampled along the reflected vector and blurred by roughness — the frost chain doubles as a prefiltered environment mip, which is why this costs almost nothing.",
  },
  wood: {
    blurb: "Rings, pores and a streaked highlight.",
    technique:
      "Domain-warped fbm for the rings, differenced into a normal so the grain catches light rather than being painted on. The highlight is anisotropic along the grain, which is the tell that separates a board from brown plastic. Grain sits in page coordinates, so resizing a panel does not stretch it.",
  },
  stone: {
    blurb: "Rough, matte, flecked, veined.",
    technique:
      "Three octaves of warped noise plus per-pixel flecks, differenced into a detail normal. Roughness 0.72, so the specular is a broad sheen rather than a point. A dusty fresnel at the edge.",
  },
  mercury: {
    blurb: "The same conductor, with the surface tension left in.",
    technique:
      "Metal's BRDF at a mirror finish, but the bevel rolls all the way across the face instead of stopping at the edge, and the micro-relief is gone. Fusing does the rest: two panels meeting run together into one bead. Metal is milled; mercury is poured.",
  },
  cloud: {
    blurb: "The one volume rather than a surface.",
    technique:
      "The silhouette is a boundary, not a shape: density is noise inside it. Light is marched five steps with Beer-Lambert transmittance and a Henyey-Greenstein phase, so it reads as lit from a direction instead of painted. Soft edges are free here, which is why cloud is easier than sand.",

 * is still here to check they survive it.
