# Plasma UI

Liquid panels for React, rendered in WebGL on canvas, inspired by Apple's Liquid Glass design. The `<Plasma>` panel looks and behaves like liquid, with surface tension that fuses on contact with other panels. Anything visible behind the panel is refracted. And for layout convenience, the panels ultimately snap to a grid layout. The library is a work in progress, extracted from the [Crux Garden](https://github.com/cruxgarden) project, but it seemed useful enough to share in its current form.

![Five panels in a workspace: one is dragged out of its group and travels as liquid, another is dropped against a neighbour and fuses into it, and each snaps to the 24px grid](docs/demo.gif)

**Status: 0.3.0.** Core is stable and tested, but the API may change.

```bash
npm install @cruxgarden/plasma-ui
```

Zero dependencies, except for React. Best on desktop: the effect is GPU-heavy
and does not run well on mobile.

```tsx
import { PlasmaProvider, Plasma } from "@cruxgarden/plasma-ui";

export function App() {
  return (
    <PlasmaProvider mood="tidal">
      <Plasma as="header" lean={false}>
        My App
      </Plasma>
      <Plasma draggable>
        <h3>Inbox</h3>
      </Plasma>
    </PlasmaProvider>
  );
}
```

## Example

[`examples/workspace`](examples/workspace) demonstrates how the library can be used for a real-world dashboard layout.

| `ground`                   | `"field" \| "clear"`                     | `"field"`      | What the canvas shows where there is no surface. `"clear"` leaves it transparent, so a second provider's canvas can sit above other content (a dialog above a scrim) and draw only its surfaces; pass the first provider's canvas as its `background` and the surfaces refract it |
| `preserveDrawingBuffer`    | `boolean`                                | `false`        | Keep each frame after it is shown so another provider can sample this canvas as its `background`. Fixed at creation |
| `formIn` | `boolean` | `true` | A new surface forms in — grows from nothing — or simply appears |
| `formSpeed` | `number` | `1` | How fast a surface forms in and out: `1` settles in about a quarter second, `2` in an eighth, `0.5` in a half |
| `formOut` | `boolean` | `false` | A removed surface forms out — shrinks to nothing from where it was — or simply vanishes |
While a surface forms in (about half a second, never under reduced motion) its element carries `data-plasma-forming` (`FORMING_ATTR`) and dispatches `plasmaforming` then `plasmaformed` (`FORMING_EVENT`, `FORMED_EVENT`; bubbling, `detail.id`). Style the children off the attribute, or listen for the events, to have the contents arrive after the material: `[data-plasma-forming] > * { opacity: 0 }` with a transition on opacity. `<Plasma>` wraps the events as `onForming` / `onFormed`; a surface registered by hand gets them on its element.

| `snap`                                  | `boolean`                | `true`   | Latch to neighbor edges, otherwise the grid                                                                         |

| `onForming()`, `onFormed()` | | | The form-in: starts (not under reduced motion), and has settled (at once under reduced motion) — reveal the contents in `onFormed` |

Everything else you pass goes to the rendered element. `PlasmaProps<C>` is the
full prop type for `<Plasma as={C}>`; `PlasmaOwnProps` is just the table above,
if you need to wrap `Plasma` in a component of your own.

Drag ignores presses on buttons, links, inputs, and anything marked `data-plasma-nodrag`.

## Hooks

| Hook                  | Returns                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `usePlasmaRuntime()`  | `renderer`, `supported`, `reducedMotion`, `pulse(x, y, strength?)`, `bump(energy)` |
| `usePlasmaDefaults()` | `tint`, `opacity`, `frost`, `radius`, `grid`, `magnet`, `spring`               |
| `usePlasma()`         | both of the above, in one object                                              |

`usePlasmaRuntime()` is the one to reach for when you only need `pulse`: its
value is stable, so a component reading it is not re-rendered every time a
styling prop on the provider changes. `usePlasma()` is the convenient one and
re-renders on any change.

## `<PlasmaCanvas>`

The provider renders the canvas itself unless you pass `canvas={false}`, in
which case render `<PlasmaCanvas />` wherever you want the element to live:

```tsx
<PlasmaProvider canvas={false}>
  <div className="page-backdrop" />
  <PlasmaCanvas zIndex={0} className="field" />
  <main>...</main>
</PlasmaProvider>
```

It takes `className`, `style` and `zIndex`. Note that this places and styles
the **element**; the renderer still draws the whole viewport. Confining the
field to a container is [roadmap](#roadmap) work, not something this prop does.

## Above a scrim: a second canvas

The material is one canvas behind everything, so a dialog above a scrim, or a
menu above the pane it opened from, could never be plasma. Two props make a
second provider possible on top of the first. The ground keeps its frames
(`preserveDrawingBuffer`) and hands its canvas out; the overlay draws with a
clear ground (`ground="clear"`): transparent outside its surfaces, only the
surfaces, their shadows and rims drawn, and what they refract is the ground
canvas passed as `background`, sampled exactly so it lines up with the page.

```tsx
// The ground, once, behind the app.
<PlasmaProvider mood="tidal" preserveDrawingBuffer canvas={false}>
  <PlasmaCanvas zIndex={-1} className="ground" />
  <App />
</PlasmaProvider>

// A dialog: its own provider inside its own stacking context, the canvas
// between the scrim and the panel, the panel registered on it.
function Dialog({ children }) {
  const ground = document.querySelector("canvas.ground");
  return (
    <div className="dialog-root">            {/* position: fixed; inset: 0 */}
      <div className="scrim" />
      <PlasmaProvider ground="clear" background={ground} canvas={false}
        pointerDrop={false} grain={0} glow={0} maxSurfaces={2}>
        <PlasmaCanvas style={{ position: "absolute", zIndex: 1 }} />
        <Plasma className="panel" elevation={0.7} style={{ zIndex: 2 }}>
          {children}
        </Plasma>
      </PlasmaProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Each overlay is a full render pass while it is open, at the same size as the
ground, plus one texture upload of the ground canvas per frame. Mount it with
the dialog and unmount it with the dialog; nothing runs while none is open.
The page under the scrim is not in the sample - WebGL cannot read the DOM -
but the scrim has already dimmed it to the field. Give the panel no fill,
border or shadow of its own: the rim is its edge and the elevation its shadow.

## Contents after the material

A surface forms in over about a quarter second when it registers (`formSpeed` scales it, `formIn={false}` skips it, and `formOut` runs the same spring backwards when a surface is removed). Content drawn
on top of it from the first frame looks as if it arrived before its panel,
so the form-in is observable: the element carries `data-plasma-forming`
(`FORMING_ATTR`) while it runs and dispatches `plasmaforming` then
`plasmaformed` (`FORMING_EVENT`, `FORMED_EVENT`; bubbling, `detail.id`).
Under reduced motion there is no form-in: no attribute, and `plasmaformed`
at once. `<Plasma>` wraps the events as `onForming` / `onFormed`.

```css
/* hold the contents back, then fade them in once the material has arrived */
[data-plasma-forming] > * { opacity: 0; transition: none; }
.panel > * { transition: opacity 160ms ease-out; }
```

```tsx
<Plasma onFormed={() => setReady(true)}>{ready && <Contents />}</Plasma>
```

## Clear as water

Six things give the material a look of its own, and each is a separate
control, so "plain glass, nothing but the lens" is a configuration rather than
a fork:

```tsx
<PlasmaProvider
  rim={0} // the iridescent edge
  highlight={0} // the specular that follows the pointer
  shimmer={0} // the sheen drifting across the body
  glow={0} // the halo cast on the background - visible even at elevation 0
  wash={0} // the material's own tint on what you see through it
  grain={0} // film grain on the background
  edgeLine={0.35} // a hairline is usually still wanted: it is what reads as an edge
  refraction={1.5}
  dispersion={1.6}
/>
```

The **Aqua** tab in the [playground](https://cruxgarden.github.io/plasma-ui/)
is exactly this, with all six sliders live next to it.

Two of these answer questions that come up often: the faint rainbow that never
went away no matter how far `rim` came down is `shimmer`, and the soft light
still hugging a panel at `elevation={0}` is `glow` - it is cast by the plasma,
not by the shadow, which really is off at `0`.

## Custom moods

```ts
import type { Mood } from "@cruxgarden/plasma-ui";

const dusk: Mood = {
  colors: ["#0b0816", "#3b2a6b", "#f0a868"],
  blend: 40,
  spring: { stiffness: 150, damping: 14 },
};
```

## Motion

Each panel undulates like a Slinky when moving. Three properties control this movement: viscosity, stretch, and flow.

```tsx
<PlasmaProvider viscosity={0.1} stretch={1.3} flow={0.6} />  // water
<PlasmaProvider viscosity={0.85} stretch={1.8} />            // honey
<PlasmaProvider stretch={0} />                               // the plasma tracks panels exactly
```

NOTE: `flow` ripples the outline, so leave it at `0` whenever flush edges should stay perfectly straight.

## Styling the rim (fancy outline)

```tsx
// solid cyan rim, a bit wider, no pointer highlight
<PlasmaProvider rimColor="#5fd4ff" rimWidth={1.6} highlight={0} />

// each panel's rim follows its own tint
<PlasmaProvider rimColor="tint">
  <Plasma tint="#ff5fa2" opacity={0.3} />
</PlasmaProvider>

// plain plasma: no colored rim, just the edge line
<PlasmaProvider rim={0} />
```

## Guidelines

- Use Plasma for container components: panels, docks, cards, dialogs. Components should be nested inside.
- Place surfaces together or further apart than the Blend distance. Smaller gaps render as liquid bridging them.
- Up to `maxSurfaces` (default 16) draw at once; offscreen panels are skipped first, and the library warns in the console when it has to drop any. Two render passes loop over every slot per pixel, so set this value only as high as you need. Changing it recompiles the shaders, so change it when the layout changes, not per frame.
- Lean and Pulse use the CSS `translate` and `scale` properties, and Drag uses `transform`. Avoid setting these properties on `Plasma` elements yourself.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` disables Lean, Pulse, the pointer Drop, and Spring - and the form-in, so `plasmaformed` fires at once.
- A second provider above a scrim (`ground="clear"`) is a full extra render pass; mount it with the dialog and unmount it with the dialog.

## Roadmap

Ordered by priority:

1. **Layers** - panels that will stack instead of fusing. A dialog above a scrim is possible today with a second provider ([above a scrim](#above-a-scrim-a-second-canvas)); true stacking inside one canvas is still to come.
2. **Drag handles and resize** - will add a `handle` prop for dragging, so panel content can be fully interactive. Also, edge resizing with grid snapping.
3. **Scroll clipping** - plasma confined to scrollable containers.
4. **Pluggable Backgrounds** - colors, images, and live canvas/video shipped in 0.1 (`background` prop); custom shaders are next.
5. **Shapes and Orientation** - non-rectangular outlines, rotation...etc.

Contributions welcome for any of these - see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Browser support

Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari 16.4+ (WebGL2). In non-supported browsers, `Plasma` renders as a CSS frosted panel and all layout, drag, and snap behavior still works.

**Use it on the desktop.** Every pass is full-viewport, so the cost scales with
the canvas, and phones pay it at a device pixel ratio the effect does not need.
It runs on mobile - resolution drops past a pixel budget, and `freezeOnScroll`
pins the last frame through a fling - but it is not where this belongs.

Server rendering works: surfaces come out as the CSS fallback with no layout
effect warnings, and the canvas takes over on hydration.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build          # library → dist/
npm run build:site     # docs + playground → site/dist/index.html
npm run build:example  # workspace example → examples/workspace/dist/index.html
npm run build:pages    # both, in the layout GitHub Pages serves → site/dist/
npm test               # snap-logic tests
npm run verify         # typecheck + tests + build, the gate CI runs
```

Every page is a single self-contained HTML file, so you can open one straight
from disk. `scripts/build-page.mjs` is the one builder they share.

Pushing to `main` deploys `npm run build:pages` to GitHub Pages:

- Site: https://cruxgarden.github.io/plasma-ui/
- Workspace example: https://cruxgarden.github.io/plasma-ui/examples/workspace/

Releases go to npm from a local machine, the same way the Crux Garden CLI
does — see [PUBLISH.md](PUBLISH.md).

## Acknowledgements

Plasma UI is built on well-known graphics and simulation techniques:

- **Blobby surfaces / metaballs** - the fuse-on-contact behavior descends from Jim Blinn's [_A Generalization of Algebraic Surface Drawing_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/357306.357310) (1982).
- **Signed distance fields** - the material is drawn with 2D SDFs combined by smooth minimum, per Inigo Quilez's [2D distance functions](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/) and [smooth minimum](https://iquilezles.org/articles/smin/) articles; the procedural background uses his [fBM](https://iquilezles.org/articles/fbm/) construction.
- **Spring integration** - panel motion uses semi-implicit Euler with fixed substeps, in the spirit of Glenn Fiedler's [_Integration Basics_](https://gafferongames.com/post/integration_basics/).
- **The optical treatment** (refraction, dispersion, frost) is an original WebGL take on the direction popularized by Apple's [Liquid Glass](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials) material.
